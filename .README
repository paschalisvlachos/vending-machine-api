Edge Cases and Security Considerations
Edge Cases:

Invalid coin denomination.
Insufficient deposit for purchase.
Not enough stock for a product.
Prevent buyers from buying non-existent products.
Security Considerations:

JWT expiration: Tokens are short-lived (1 hour) to reduce security risks.
Session control: Each active session is tracked in activeSessions for better control of login and logout processes.
Password hashing: Passwords are hashed using bcryptjs before storing in the database.

Edge Cases:

Deposit:
Ensure only valid coins are accepted.
Test deposits with empty arrays or invalid coins.
Buy:
Ensure the buyer has enough deposit for the purchase.
Test insufficient stock and invalid product IDs.
User Registration:
Ensure users cannot register with duplicate usernames.
Ensure users cannot register without a valid role.
Test Validation:

After running the tests, ensure that each test passes and correctly covers the expected behaviors.
If any tests fail, inspect the test output to debug the issue.
